## Backend Overview
The backend of the Next.js Job Board Application is built using Django, utilizing the Django Rest Framework (DRF) for building robust RESTful APIs. It incorporates several advanced features and third-party integrations to ensure secure and efficient operation.

## Key Features
- **Django Rest Framework (DRF)**: Empowers the backend with a powerful toolkit for building Web APIs, offering serialization, authentication, and authorization capabilities out of the box.
- **Google Single Sign-On (SSO)**: Integrates Google SSO for seamless and secure authentication, enabling users to sign in with their Google accounts.
- **Stripe Payment Processing**: Utilizes the Stripe API to handle payment processing securely, allowing users to make transactions for job postings and other premium features.
- **Bleach for Sanitization**: Implements Bleach to sanitize user-generated content, mitigating the risk of XSS attacks and ensuring data integrity.
- **JWT Authentication**: Implements JSON Web Token (JWT) authentication for secure user authentication and authorization, providing stateless authentication mechanisms.
- **Redis**: Utilizes Redis for caching and session management, enhancing performance and scalability.
- **PostgreSQL Database**: Utilizes PostgreSQL as the primary database management system, offering reliability, scalability, and robust SQL support.
- **PG Admin 4**: Integrates PG Admin 4 for managing PostgreSQL databases, providing a user-friendly interface for database administration and maintenance.
- **Geocoder for Mapping Locations**: Incorporates Geocoder to map job locations, providing geospatial functionality and enhancing the user experience with location-based features.
- **Pipenv**: Utilizes Pipenv for dependency management, ensuring a consistent and reproducible development environment.

## Architecture
The backend architecture is designed to be scalable, secure, and efficient. DRF provides a flexible framework for building APIs, while JWT authentication ensures secure user authentication. Stripe integration enables seamless payment processing, and Bleach sanitization mitigates security risks associated with user-generated content. Redis caching enhances performance, and PostgreSQL serves as a robust and reliable database management system. PG Admin 4 offers a convenient interface for managing databases, while Geocoder enhances the application with geospatial capabilities.
